# ID Lock Implementation Notes

## Auto-Lock Feature Implementation
The auto-lock feature has been successfully implemented using standard Homey capabilities:

### Capabilities
- `onoff`: Controls auto-lock enable/disable
- `dim`: Controls auto-lock delay time (5-30 seconds)
- `locked`: Door lock state
- `contact_alarm`: Door state
- `measure_battery`: Battery level

### Settings Integration
- Auto-lock settings are synchronized between Z-Wave configuration and device settings
- Settings are persisted across reboots
- Values are properly validated before being applied

### User Interface
- Auto-lock toggle visible in main interface
- Delay time adjustable via slider
- Clear status indicators for lock and door state
- Battery level monitoring

### Configuration Parameters
- Parameter 1: Auto-lock enabled/disabled
- Parameter 5: Auto-lock delay time
- Values are synchronized between UI and Z-Wave configuration

### Performance
- Reliable auto-locking behavior
- Proper status updates
- Efficient battery usage
- Stable Z-Wave communication

## Testing Results
- Auto-lock activates correctly when door closes
- Delay timer functions as expected
- Settings persist correctly
- UI updates in real-time
- Battery monitoring works reliably

## Notes
- Using standard Homey capabilities improves reliability
- Z-Wave secure communication working properly
- Settings and capability values properly synchronized
