# Project Progress - ID Lock Auto-Lock Implementation

## Current Status (May 1, 2025)

### Working Features
1. Basic Lock Operations
   - Lock/Unlock commands
   - Status reporting
   - Battery monitoring
   - Door state detection

2. Security Implementation
   - S0 security level achieved
   - Basic secure communication working
   - Command Class Security (v1) operational

3. Notification Handling
   - Door state changes
   - Lock state changes
   - Battery reports
   - Error conditions

### Outstanding Issues
1. Auto-Lock Configuration
   - Cannot modify lock's internal auto-lock settings
   - App-based timer solution unreliable
   - Configuration commands not accepted by lock

2. Security Encapsulation
   - Potential issues with command encapsulation
   - Configuration commands possibly not properly secured
   - Need to verify security implementation

## Implementation History

### Attempt 1: Direct Configuration
- Used COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION
- Parameter 1 targeting
- Failed due to format issues

### Attempt 2: Door Lock Commands
- Tried DOOR_LOCK_CONFIGURATION
- Commands acknowledged but ineffective
- Possible security wrapping issues

### Attempt 3: Raw Commands
- Direct Z-Wave payload attempts
- Not compatible with Homey framework
- No success in changing settings

### Attempt 4: App-Based Solution
- Software timer implementation
- Works but not reliable
- Not synchronized with lock state

## Technical Findings

1. Command Class Support
   - All basic operations supported
   - Configuration commands present but not working
   - Security framework in place

2. Security Implementation
   - S0 security level working
   - S2 not achieved/needed
   - Basic operations secure

3. Configuration Issues
   - Format problems
   - Timing/sequence issues
   - Possible security encapsulation problems

## Next Actions

1. Code Repository
   - Update GitHub with current state
   - Document all attempts and findings
   - Prepare for next implementation phase

2. Technical Investigation
   - Review security encapsulation
   - Analyze command sequences
   - Consider alternative approaches

3. Testing Requirements
   - Verify security levels
   - Test command acceptance
   - Monitor state synchronization

## Resources Used
1. Z-Wave Documentation
2. ID Lock 150 Manual
3. Homey Framework Docs
4. Similar Implementations (Ted's version)

## Questions to Address
1. Security Level Requirements
2. Command Sequencing
3. Implementation Alternatives
4. Reliability vs Functionality
