# Z-Wave Implementation Notes - ID Lock Auto-Lock Feature

## Attempted Implementations

### 1. Direct Z-Wave Configuration
- Tried using COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION with Parameter 1
- Error: invalid_type_expecting_object ["Level"]
- Issue: Configuration data format not accepted by lock

### 2. Door Lock Configuration
- Attempted DOOR_LOCK_CONFIGURATION commands
- Lock acknowledged but did not change behavior
- Possible missing security encapsulation

### 3. Raw Z-Wave Commands
- Tried direct payload: 0x700501
- Not proper way to communicate in Homey framework
- No success in changing auto-lock state

### 4. App-Based Timer Solution
- Works technically but lacks reliability
- Not synchronized with lock's actual state
- Only temporary workaround

## Security Analysis

### Current Implementation
- Only achieves S0 security level
- COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY (v1) present
- Basic lock operations work
- Configuration commands possibly not properly secured

### Command Classes Available
```javascript
- COMMAND_CLASS_ZWAVEPLUS_INFO (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_MANUFACTURER_SPECIFIC (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_SECURITY (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_POWERLEVEL (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_CONFIGURATION (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_BASIC (v0)
- COMMAND_CLASS_VERSION (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_DOOR_LOCK (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_USER_CODE (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_ASSOCIATION_GRP_INFO (v1)
- COMMAND_CLASS_NOTIFICATION (v4)
- COMMAND_CLASS_FIRMWARE_UPDATE_MD (v2)
- COMMAND_CLASS_BATTERY (v1)
```

## Key Findings

1. Security Encapsulation:
   - Configuration commands might need security encapsulation
   - Current implementation missing proper security wrapper
   - Could explain why auto-lock settings not accepted

2. S0 vs S2 Security:
   - Only achieved S0 security level
   - Might be hardware limitation of ID Lock 150
   - Basic functions work with S0
   - Not necessarily a problem

3. Command Sequencing:
   - Potential need for specific command sequence
   - Security verification before configuration
   - Proper timing between commands

## Lessons Learned

1. Security Implementation:
   - S0 security sufficient for basic operations
   - Need proper security encapsulation for configuration

2. Configuration Commands:
   - Format matters significantly
   - Timing and sequence important
   - Need verification of command acceptance

3. Auto-Lock Implementation:
   - Hardware vs software solution trade-offs
   - Reliability considerations
   - State synchronization challenges

## Next Steps to Consider

1. Security Enhancement:
   - Implement proper security encapsulation
   - Verify command acceptance
   - Maintain consistent security state

2. Configuration Approach:
   - Review command sequencing
   - Implement proper verification
   - Consider alternative configuration methods

3. Testing Strategy:
   - Verify each command individually
   - Test security encapsulation
   - Monitor command acceptance

## Open Questions

1. Security Level:
   - Is S2 actually needed?
   - Can S0 support all features?
   - Hardware limitations?

2. Configuration:
   - Correct parameter formats?
   - Required command sequence?
   - Verification methods?

3. Implementation:
   - Balance between reliability and functionality?
   - Hardware vs software solutions?
   - Synchronization requirements?
