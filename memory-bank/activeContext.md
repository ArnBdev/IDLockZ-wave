# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**
The primary current challenge is fixing the Code Management UI, which is visible in global settings but gets stuck at "Loading codes...".

**Recent Changes:**
- Implemented robust data handling and improved debugging features in the Code Management UI.
- Fixed Autolock and Z-Wave Command Timeouts using `Promise.race()` and non-blocking operations.
- Confirmed the decision to use only the IDLock150 driver for ID Lock 202 Multi and updated code references accordingly.
- Updated Z-Wave parameters in the driver to match ID Lock 202 Multi specifications.
- Implemented UI improvements inspired by the Better Logic Library app, including stepwise data loading and fallback to standard codes.

**Next Steps:**
- The immediate next step is to fix the Code Management UI loading issue.
- After that, planned features include adding temporary access code functionality, implementing access attempt logging, and adding suspicious activity detection and alerts.
- Future UI improvements based on Better Logic Library are also planned (tab-based structure, separate RFID tab, history view).

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- The decision to use the IDLock150 driver for ID Lock 202 Multi is final.
- The Code Management UI will remain at the global app level (`settings/`).
- Graceful timeout handling for Z-Wave commands is a key pattern to maintain.
- The effectiveness of the Memory Bank relies on keeping these markdown files updated.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**
- The developer is new to coding and prefers basic, step-by-step explanations with clear reasons ("why").
- The pedagogical approach involves starting simple, building complexity gradually, testing each change, and documenting learning points.
- Code examples with comments and Norwegian explanations are preferred.
- The developer has previous experience with a non-completed Zigbee project.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
- The shared Z-Wave ID between ID Lock 150 and 202 requires careful driver management.
- Homey's settings API and global settings folder are key for implementing device-specific settings UI.
- Graceful handling of Z-Wave command timeouts is essential for a good user experience.
- Inspiration from existing successful Homey apps (like Better Logic Library) can significantly improve UI and data handling.
- Previous conversations with AI (Copilot Chat) contain valuable context about past issues and decisions.
